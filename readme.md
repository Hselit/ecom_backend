## Authentication legend

| Mark | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **🔓** | Public — no `Authorization` header required |
| **🔐** | Authorized — send a valid JWT: `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (obtain via `POST /login`) |

> Routes under `/access`, `/category`, `/product`, `/cart`, `/order`, `/review`, `/inventory`, and product-image paths are protected at the router level in `app.ts` (middleware runs before the handlers). `/user` mixes public and protected routes as listed below.
